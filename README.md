This C program simulates a basic cricket scoreboard for two teams. It allows the user to input team details, including the team name, captain's name, and player names along with their respective runs. 
The program then calculates the total runs for each team and displays a scoreboard for both teams, showing individual player scores.
After displaying the scoreboards, the program compares the total runs of the two teams to determine and display the winner. 
If the scores are tied, it outputs a draw message. The program uses standard input/output functions to interact with the user.
